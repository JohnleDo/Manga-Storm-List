# MangaStorm List Updater/Extractor
This program is used for updating the Kitsu Website with the .msbf file you get from the MangaStorm app. To get this up
and running is by:
1. Going to the MangaStorm app and in the top right-hand corner press on the little box and then select
"Share/Backup Favorites". 
2. Have the app send you're manga information to your email. 
3. Go to email and download the file and save the file into the same directory as this git repo.
4. Run listupdate.py using python 3 as such: `python3 listupdate.py`. Also make sure to have all the necessary packages
installed.
5. It will then ask you to enter your Kitsu credentials. Do that and then select whichever menu option that fits your
needs and follow the onscreen instruction.
